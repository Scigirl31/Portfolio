  <p style="text-align:right;">
    I`m a current student at Midwood High School and <br>   
    all of my interests revolve around engineering and tech. <br> 
    I have done hands on engineering <br>
    before at an apprenticeship at NYU Tech. <br>
    I`m taking online courses at Udacity<br>
    to learn html, css and basically <br>
    intro to all types of programming.<br>
    Currently im doing girls who code and <br>
    this is a project for todays class.<br>
    A portfolio about me!<br>

     <p>I don`t like oranges due to its acidity. <br>
          I don`t eat them often or at not all even. <br>
          To be honest I barely eat any fruits besides apples. <br>
          But that does not mean I like apple juice! <br>

    <p>Too many ads! <br>
         Ads are okay until <br>
         they slow down your internet speed. Like I don`t even get a chance <br>
         to check my yahoo email 
         due to the amount of ads that pop up. It evens makes me feel unsafe.

      <p>To Udacity`s online classes, I have felt more confident. <br>
         I learned most of my html from them. <br>
         They also kind of keep you from not coming back to class.<br>
         You have to submit projects and they keep you motivated. <br>
