  <p style="text-align:right;">
    I`m a current student at Midwood High School and <br>
    all of my interests revolve around engineering and tech. <br>
    I have done hands on engineering <br>
    before at an apprenticeship at NYU Tech. <br>
    I`m taking online courses at Udacity<br>
    to learn html, css and basically <br>
    intro to all types of programming.<br>
    Currently im doing girls who code and <br>
    this is a project for todays class.<br>
    A portfolio about me!<br>

    <p>I think kittens are adorable!<br>
      Sadly I dont have a kitten of my own but<br> 
      in the near future I would definitely get one! </p>

     <p>Without this program I wouldnt have been able<br>
       to meet girls who had the same interests as me.<br>
       Most of the girls in my school want to <br>
       be doctors or some kind of business person. </p>

     <p>I don`t like oranges due to its acidity. <br>
          I don`t eat them often or at not all even. <br>
          To be honest I barely eat any fruits besides apples. <br>
          But that does not mean I like apple juice! <br>

<img id="Ads" src="http://adsoftheworld.com/apple-touch-icon.png" alt="Ads"> 
    <p>Too many ads! <br>
         Ads are okay until <br>
         they slow down your internet speed.<br>
         Like I don`t even get a chance <br>
         to check my yahoo email <br>
         due to the amount of ads that pop up. <br>
         It evens makes me feel unsafe. <br>

    <p> Loud Places with a lot of people. <br>
         I barely go to places with a lot of people due <br> 
         to the noises and a lot of things happening all at once. <br>

      <p>To Udacity`s online classes, I have felt more confident. <br>
         I learned most of my html from them. <br>
         They also kind of keep you from not coming back to class.<br>
         You have to submit projects and they keep you motivated. <br>

    <p> Codeacadamy was the very first thing that taught me to code. <br>
        Most of my teachers in middle school introduced it to me. <br>
        Its considered a starting piont for <br>
        kids who want to purse the STEM field. <br>

    <p> Youtube is one of the few ways I connect with the world. <br>
         I also watch LastWeekTonight and TheDailyShow <br>
         to relax but also be informed about the world. <br>
